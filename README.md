# maze-solver

## Ideas for extending the project
* Add other solving algorithms, like breadth-first search or A*
* Make the visuals prettier, change the colors, etc
* Mess with the animation settings to make it faster/slower. Maybe make backtracking slow and blazing new paths faster?
* Add configurations in the app itself using Tkinter buttons and inputs to allow users to change maze size, speed, etc
* Make much larger mazes to solve
* Make it a game where the user chooses directions
* If you made it a game, allow the user to race an algorithm
* Make it 3 dimensional
* Time the various algorithms and see which ones are the fastest
